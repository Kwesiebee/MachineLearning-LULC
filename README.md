# Machine Learning for Land Use Land Cover Classification(LULC)
This resource seeks to introduce geospatial student like myself to model building using the Random Forest Algorithm. 
It demonstrates the procedure for model building which includes data partitioning (train and test data), training of the model using the train data,tuning of the model, assessment of cross-validation results, evaluation of the model using the test data.
It also further introduces the concept feature selection mainly the recursive feature elimination(rfe).
Lastly, it demonstrates how to make spatial prediction with the built model.
All this made possible with the caret package in R.
